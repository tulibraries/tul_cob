Cannot upgrade minimatch to 10.2.1 in this repository without major dependency upgrades.
Installed vulnerable versions: minimatch@3.1.2 and minimatch@9.0.5.
Reason: minimatch@3.1.2 is pulled by glob@7 from @rails/webpacker and minimatch@9.0.5 is pulled by glob@10 from Jest/reporting dependencies; both are locked transitive ranges and do not accept minimatch 10.
