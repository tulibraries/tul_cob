Cannot upgrade ajv to 8.18.0 or 6.14.0 in this repository without a broader toolchain migration.
Installed vulnerable version: ajv@6.12.6.
Reason: ajv@6.12.6 is required transitively by schema-utils@2.x/3.x from @rails/webpacker (via babel-loader, terser-webpack-plugin, webpack-assets-manifest), and those dependencies are locked to ajv 6.
