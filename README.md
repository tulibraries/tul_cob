# Library Search

Library Search is a [Blacklight](https://projectblacklight.org/) project at Temple University Libraries for the discovery of library resources. See https://librarysearch.temple.edu/ for our production site.

The first phase of this project (i.e. TUL "Catalog on Blacklight") focused on search for our catalog records and fulfillment integration with our ILS, Alma. It now also includes discovery for: Primo Central Index article records, Springshare A-Z database records, and [library website content](https://github.com/tulibraries/manifold). 

The following repositories are also critical components for Solr indexing and other integrations in the Library Search: 
* Processing pipeline: https://github.com/tulibraries/cob_datapipeline
* Catalog: https://github.com/tulibraries/cob_index, https://github.com/tulibraries/tul_cob-catalog-solr 
* A-Z databases: https://github.com/tulibraries/cob_az_index, https://github.com/tulibraries/tul_cob-az-solr
* Web content: https://github.com/tulibraries/cob_web_index, https://github.com/tulibraries/tul_cob-web-solr
* Article index: https://github.com/tulibraries/primo

## Getting started


### Install the Application
This only needs to happen the first time.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tulibraries/tul_cob
cd tul_cob
bundle install
cp config/secrets.yml.example config/secrets.yml
```

We also need to configure the application with our Alma and Primo apikey for development work on the Bento box or User account. Start by copying the example alma and bento config files.

```bash
cp config/alma.yml.example config/alma.yml
cp config/bento.yml.example config/bento.yml
```

Then edit them adding in the API keys for our application specified in our Ex Libris Developer Network.

```bash
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

### Start the Application

We need to run two commands in separate terminal windows in order to start the application.
* In the first terminal window, start solr with run
```bash
bundle exec rake server
```

### Start the Application with some sample data for Development

You can also have it ingest a few thousand sample records by setting the
`DO_INGEST` environment variable to yes. For example:

`DO_INGEST="yes" bundle exec rake server`

### Start the Application using Docker as an alternative

If Docker is available, we defined a Makefile with many useful commands.

* To start the dockerized app, run ```make up```
* To stop the dockerized app, run ```make down```
* To restart the app, run ```make restart```
* To enter into the app container, run ```make tty-app```
* To enter into the solr container, run ```make tty-solr```
* To run the linter, run ```make lint```
* To run the Ruby tests, run ```make test```
* To run Javascript tests, run ```make test-js```
* To load sample data, run ```DO_INGEST=yes make up``` or ```make load-data```
* To reload solr configs, run ```make reload-configs```
* To attatch to the running app container (good for debugging) ```make attach``

### Preparing Alma Data

For the marcxml sample data that has been generated by Alma and exported by FTP, it needs to be processed before committing it to the sample_data folder:

```bash

./bin/massage.sh sample_data/alma_bibs.xml

```

### Ingest the sample Alma data with Traject

Now you are ready to ingest:

The simplest way to ingest a marc data file into your local solr is with the `ingest` rake task. Called with no parameters, it will ingest the data at [sample_data/alma_bibs.xml](https://github.com/tulibraries/tul_cob/blob/main/sample_data/alma_bibs.xml)


```bash
bundle exec rake ingest
```

You can also pass in their path to a separate file you would like to ingest as a parameter

```bash
bundle exec rake ingest[/some/other/path.xml]
```

If you need to ingest a file multiple times locally an not have it rejected by SOLR do to update_date you can set `SOLR_DISABLE_UPDATE_DATE_CHECK=yes`:

```bash
SOLR_DISABLE_UPDATE_DATE_CHECK=yes rake ingest[spec/fixtures/purchase_online_bibs.xml]
```

Under the hood, that command uses [traject](https://github.com/traject/traject), with hard coded defaults. If you need to override a default to ingest your data, You can call traject directly:

```bash
bundle exec traject -s solr.url=http://somehere/solr -c lib/traject/indexer_config.rb sample_data/alma_bibs.xml
```

If using docker, then ingest using `docker-compose exec app traject -c app/models/traject_indexer.rb sample_data/alma_bibs.xml`.

### Ingesting URLs
Additionally, you can now use `bin/ingest.rb`. This is a ruby executable that
works on both files and URLs. So now, if you want to quickly ingest a marc xml
record from production, you can run something like:

```bash
bin/ingest.rb http://example.com/catalog/foo.xml
```

### Ingest AZ Database data
AZ Database fixture data is loaded automatically when you run
`bundle exec rake tul_cob:solr:load_fixtures`. If you want to ingest a single file or URL, use `bundle exec cob_az_index ingest $path_to_file_or_url`.

Note: If you make an update to cob_az_index, you will need to run `bundle update cob_az_index` locally.


### Ingest web content data
Web content fixture data is loaded automatically when you run
`bundle exec rake tul_cob:solr:load_fixtures`. If you want to ingest a single file or URL, use `bundle exec cob_web_index ingest $path_to_file_or_url`.

Note: If you make an update to cob_web_index, you will need to run `bundle update cob_web_index` locally.

## Importing from Alma

In order to import from Alma directly execute the following Rake tasks. Harvest may be supplied with
an optional date/time ranges in ISO8901 format and enclosed in brackets. You may provide `from` and/or `ta`o
date/times. You may not provide only a `to` date/time

```bash
bundle exec rake tul_cob:oai:harvest[from,to]
bundle exec rake tul_cob:oai:conform_all
bundle exec rake tul_cob:oai:ingest_all
```

## Running the Tests

`bundle exec rake ci` will start solr, clean out all solr records, ingest the
test records, and run your test suite.

`bundle exec rake rspec` will start your solr and run your test suite, assuming
you already have the test records in your test solr.

The `rake rspec` rake task can also take any `rspec` command line parameters, for
example to [use a seed to determine order](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-7/docs/command-line/order) , you can run:

`bundle exec rake rspec["--seed=12345"]`

### Relevance Tests

#### Running Lib Guides relevance tests

Do to the the fact that we are effectively testing an outside service for the
LibGuides relevance tests, we do not run these tests on the CI.  To run
locally export appropriate values for the `$LIB_GUIDES_API_KEY`  `$LIB_GUIDES_SITE_ID`
environment variables and point `$SOLR_URL` to the production solr.

Then run `make test-libguides-relevance`


#### Ingest LibGuide AZ documents
Locally you will need to add 'az-database' core to solr (handled automatically for docker/libqa/production)

Ingest AZ database documents by running

```
./bin/libguide_cache.rb
./bin/ingest-libguides.sh
```
