    introduction: "An enhanced version of the Library Search is currently under development at Temple University Libraries. This new search interface is currently in beta and contains only records from our local collections (such as books, journals, and media). As work continues through the Spring 2018 semester, the Libraries will incrementally be adding new features and incorporating more records, including those for online articles."
