Eurasian otters feed on vertebrates, such as fishes, and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, but their detailed taxonomies are not fully understood in part due to limited resolving power of traditional morphological identification methods. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based DNA metabarcoding approaches to analyze diet profiles of Eurasian otters inhabiting a marshy estuary area in Korea. We investigated their diet profiles based on spraint sampling followed by DNA metabarcoding analyses targeting 12S rRNA gene region for vertebrates, 16S rRNA gene region for invertebrates, and cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene region for fishes. For the vertebrate analysis, a blocking oligonucleotide (OBS1) was designed to suppress amplification of DNA fragments derived from the otters. The 12S rRNA gene sequencing assay detected species belonging to fishes (95%) and amphibians (3.3%). Fishes detected by 12S rRNA gene sequencing included crucian carp (Carassius auratus), mullets (Mugil spp.), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and northern snakehead (Channa argus), which were also detected by COI gene sequencing. Among invertebrates, mud flat crabs (Helicana spp.) and shrimps (Palaemon spp.) were abundant. The designed blocking oligonucleotide OBS1 effectively inhibited amplification of the otter's DNA, with only up to 0.21% of vertebrate sequence reads assigned to the otter. This study demonstrated that HTS-based DNA metabarcoding methods were useful to provide in-depth information regarding diet profiles of the otters at our sampling site.

its recent invasion into the marine realm, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) has evolved a suite of adaptations for life in cold coastal waters, including limb modifications and dense insulating fur. This uniquely dense coat led to the near-extinction of sea otters during the 18th–20th century fur trade and an extreme population bottleneck. We used the de novo genome of the southern sea otter (E. l. nereis) to reconstruct its evolutionary history, identify genes influencing aquatic adaptation, and detect signals of population bottlenecks. We compared the genome of the southern sea otter with the tropical freshwater-living giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) to assess common and divergent genomic trends between otter species, and with the closely related northern sea otter (E. l. kenyoni) to uncover population-level trends. We found signals of positive selection in genes related to aquatic adaptations, particularly limb development and polygenic selection on genes related to hair follicle development. We found extensive pseudogenization of olfactory receptor genes in both the sea otter and giant otter lineages, consistent with patterns of sensory gene loss in other aquatic mammals. At the population level, the southern sea otter and the northern sea otter showed extremely low genomic diversity, signals of recent inbreeding, and demographic histories marked by population declines. These declines may predate the fur trade and appear to have resulted in an increase in putatively deleterious variants that could impact the future recovery of the sea otter."],"title":["Aquatic Adaptation and Depleted Diversity: A Deep Dive into the Genomes of the Sea Otter and Giant Otter","Molecular biology and evolution"],"creationdate":["2019"],"recordid":["eNp9Uk1v1DAQtRCILgtHrihHDiz1xI4dc0DatrAgVeqBj6tlx7NdoyROY2dR-fW4m7LQCye_Gb9582w9Ql4CfQtUsdMutBb3p138BRQekQVUTK5AgnpMFlRmzCmrT8izGH9QCpwL8ZScMCihZMAWZLe-mUzyTbF2ZkgZhb4wvSsucGgxYQZ-j2P06fZdsc5dHA6dwvcpFGmHxQb70GEswvZQfkFTXKWE40Fl402f5vo5ebI1bcQX9-eSfPv44ev5p9Xl1ebz-fpy1VRllVYMttZaV0nlGimss84oBYKySjqFlTEWK1XCVgkLTknkiNyKBuqaAxfSsCV5M-vGnzhMVg-j78x4q4Px-sJ_X-swXutp0pzmnxKZ_n6mZ26HrsE-jaZ9MPXwpvc7fR32Wioh6xqywNksEAbsjR_xOOuC1w7dNOjGOeC2loAoSmEqZKJGkKysa-YUvTP9-t7FGG4mjEl3PjbYtqbHMEVdlpxxVZfZ8pKsZmozhhhH3B73AdV3idBzIvSciMx_9e8Dj-w_Efi7O2Sn_9f6DZI1wf4"],"recordtype":["article"],"creator":["Beichman, Annabel C","Koepfli, Klaus-Peter","Li, Gang","Murphy, William","Dobrynin, Pasha","Kliver, Sergei","Tinker, Martin T","Murray, Michael J","Johnson, Jeremy","Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin","Karlsson, Elinor K","Lohmueller, Kirk E","Wayne, Robert K"],"subject":["Adaptation","Adaptation, Biological - genetics","Animals","Aquatic adaptation","Biological Evolution","deleterious variation","demography","Enhydra lutris","Fast Track","Genetic Variation","genomics","Giant otter","olfaction","Otter","Otters - genetics","parasitic diseases","Population","Population bottleneck","Population genetics","pseudogenes","sea otter","Selection, Genetic","Whole Genome Sequencing","Zoology"],"issn":["0737-4038","1537-1719","1537-1719"],"fulltext":["true"],"addtitle":["Mol Biol Evol"],"general":["Oxford University Press"],"startdate":["20191201"],"enddate":["20191201"],"scope":["CGR","CUY","CVF","ECM","EIF","NPM","AAYXX","CITATION","7X8","BOBZL","CLFQK","5PM","ADTPV","AOWAS","DF2"],"creatorcontrib":["Beichman, Annabel C","Koepfli, Klaus-Peter","Li, Gang","Murphy, William","Dobrynin, Pasha","Kliver, Sergei","Tinker, Martin T","Murray, Michael J","Johnson, Jeremy","Lindblad-Toh, Kerstin","Karlsson, Elinor K","Lohmueller, Kirk E","Wayne, Robert K"],"rsrctype":["article"]},"delivery":{"fulltext":["fulltext_linktorsrc"],"delcategory":["Remote Search Resource"]},"display":{"description":["Abstract\nDespite its recent invasion into the marine realm, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) has evolved a suite of adaptations for life in cold coastal waters, including limb modifications and dense insulating fur.

Knowledge of copulatory behaviour, age of breeding, female reproductive anatomy, and genitalic interactions during intromission is needed for comprehensive understanding of bacular anatomy, allometry, and variation for these species."],"jtitle":["Canadian journal of zoology"],"genre":["article"],"au":["Miller, Edward H.","Jung, Thomas S.","Kukka, Piia M.","Reynolds, John J.","Grove, Robert A.","Stenson, Garry B.","Rogers, Robert P.W."],"atitle":["Growth, allometry, and characteristics of a sexually selected structure in wolverine ( Gulo gulo (Linnaeus, 1758)), northern river otter ( Lontra canadensis (Linnaeus, 1758)), and sea otter ( Enhydra lutris (Linnaeus, 1758))"],"date":["2023-05-25"],"risdate":["2023"],"eissn":["1480-3283"],"ristype":["JOUR"],"pub":["Canadian Science Publishing"],"doi":["10.1139/cjz-2022-0202"]}},"delivery":{"link":[],"deliveryCategory":["Remote Search Resource"],"availability":["fulltext"],"displayLocation":false,"additionalLocations":false,"physicalItemTextCodes":"","feDisplayOtherLocations":false,"displayedAvailability":"true","holding":[],"almaOpenurl":"https://na02.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/uresolver/01TULI_INST/openurl?ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8\u0026ctx_id=10_1\u0026ctx_tim=2024-03-06 18:08:01\u0026ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx\u0026url_ver=Z39.88-2004\u0026rfr_id=info:sid/primo.exlibrisgroup.com-openaire_cross\u0026rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal\u0026rft.genre=article\u0026rft.atitle=Growth%2C+allometry%2C+and+characteristics+of+a+sexually+selected+structure+in+wolverine+%28+Gulo+gulo+%28Linnaeus%2C+1758%29%29%2C+northern+river+otter+%28+Lontra+canadensis+%28Linnaeus%2C+1758%29%29%2C+and+sea+otter+%28+Enhydra+lutris+%28Linnaeus%2C+1758%29%29\u0026rft.jtitle=Canadian+journal+of+zoology\u0026rft.au=Miller%2C+Edward+H.\u0026rft.date=2023-05-25\u0026rft.issn=0008-4301\u0026rft.eissn=1480-3283\u0026rft_id=info:doi/10.1139%2Fcjz-2022-0202\u0026rft.pub=Canadian+Science+Publishing\u0026rft_dat=\u003copenaire_cross\u003e10.1139%2Fcjz-2022-0202\u003c/openaire_cross\u003e\u0026svc_dat=viewit"},"context":"PC","adaptor":"Primo Central","extras":{"citationTrails":{"citing":["FETCH-LOGICAL-c238t-6d3a1d3bd87a38c46e4823a1327955839a5b49ed75e344e92e6a4dbe26aaf983"],"citedby":[]},"timesCited":{}},"@id":"https://na02.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/primaws/rest/pub/pnxs/PC/cdi_openaire_primary_doi_0301b07f243bcaa3f40935396da78333"},{"pnx":{"sort":{"author":["Deur, Douglas ;

Monitoring of the marine environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters.

Monitoring of the marine environment for secondary impacts has been minimal, although microcystin-contaminated freshwater is known to be entering marine ecosystems. Here we confirm deaths of marine mammals from microcystin intoxication and provide evidence implicating land-sea flow with trophic transfer through marine invertebrates as the most likely route of exposure. This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources, sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and microcystin concentrations up to 2,900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean. Deaths of 21 southern sea otters, a federally listed threatened species, were linked to microcystin intoxication. Finally, farmed and free-living marine clams, mussels and oysters of species that are often consumed by sea otters and humans exhibited significant biomagnification (to 107 times ambient water levels) and slow depuration of freshwater cyanotoxins, suggesting a potentially serious environmental and public health threat that extends from the lowest trophic levels of nutrient-impaired freshwater habitat to apex marine predators. Microcystin-poisoned sea otters were commonly recovered near river mouths and harbors and contaminated marine bivalves were implicated as the most likely source of this potent hepatotoxin for wild otters. This is the first report of deaths of marine mammals due to cyanotoxins and confirms the existence of a novel class of marine \"harmful algal bloom\" in the Pacific coastal environment; that of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP), suggesting that animals and humans are at risk from microcystin poisoning when consuming shellfish harvested at the land-sea interface."],"jtitle":["PloS one"],"genre":["article"],"au":["Miller, Melissa A","Kudela, Raphael M","Mekebri, Abdu","Crane, Dave","Oates, Stori C","Tinker, M Timothy","Staedler, Michelle","Miller, Woutrina A","Toy-Choutka, Sharon","Dominik, Clare","Hardin, Dane","Langlois, Gregg","Murray, Michael","Ward, Kim","Jessup, David A"],"atitle":["Evidence for a novel marine harmful algal bloom: cyanotoxin (microcystin) transfer from land to sea otters"],"date":["2010-09-10"],"risdate":["2010"],"volume":["5"],"issue":["9"],"spage":["e12576"],"pages":["e12576-"],"eissn":["1932-6203"],"oa":["free_for_read"],"notes":["ObjectType-Article-1","SourceType-Scholarly Journals-1","ObjectType-Feature-2","Conceived and designed the experiments: MAM RMK SCO CD DH KW DAJ.

The sea otter (Enhydra lutris) is a unique model in this regard. Their dramatic decline from thousands to fewer than 100 individuals per population occurred range‐wide and nearly simultaneously due to the 18th–19th century fur trade. Consequently, each sea otter population represents an independent natural experiment of recovery after extreme population decline. We designed sequence capture probes for 50 Mb of sea otter exonic and neutral genomic regions. We sequenced 107 sea otters from five populations that span the species range to high coverage (18–76×) and three historical Californian samples from ~1500 and ~200 years ago to low coverage (1.5–3.5×). We observe distinct population structure and find that sea otters in California are the last survivors of a divergent lineage isolated for thousands of years and therefore warrant special conservation concern. We detect signals of extreme population decline in every surviving sea otter population and use this demographic history to design forward‐in‐time simulations of coding sequence. Our simulations indicate that this decline could lower the fitness of recovering populations for generations. However, the simulations also demonstrate how historically low effective population sizes prior to the fur trade may have mitigated the effects of population decline on genetic health. Our comprehensive approach shows how demographic inference from genomic data, coupled with simulations, allows assessment of extinction risk and different models of recovery.\nsee also the Perspective by Julia M.
