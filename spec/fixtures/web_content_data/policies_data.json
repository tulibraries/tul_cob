      "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The University Libraries are primarily for the use of faculty, students, and other members of the Temple community. However, individuals not affiliated with the University may enter the Libraries prior to 10:00 pm on any night the library is open past that hour, as long as they provide photo identification upon request, sign an entrance log if requested to do so, and observe the&nbsp;Code of Conduct for Library Users. In addition, as a Federal Depository Library, we make Government publications received through the depository program available for the free use of the general public.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">This policy governs access to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\">University Libraries</a>&nbsp;during&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/about/hours?location=17\">hours</a>&nbsp;the individual locations are open.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Implementation of this policy is the shared responsibility of the Libraries and Campus Safety Services staff. In Paley Library and Tuttleman Learning Center, security personnel perform the initial screening of entering persons. At Library locations other than Paley or Tuttleman, library staff members may screen persons on the library premises. Whenever it is unclear whether a person should be admitted to one of the University Libraries, a library staff member who is familiar with the policy should be consulted for a final decision.</p>\r\n<h2>Access Rules</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Temple Faculty, Students and Staff with University ID card</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Anyone with a current valid Temple University ID may enter the University Libraries without restriction during normal operating hours.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Adults without University ID card</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Persons without a current valid Temple University ID are required to provide an alternative form of photo ID (such as a valid driver's license) upon request and must sign an entrance log if requested to do so. There is no admittance after 10 pm on any evening the library is open past that time. Persons with no photo ID may be refused admittance.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Adults with Temple Alumni cards or Temple Library Courtesy Cards</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Persons with alumni or courtesy cards are required to provide a photo ID (such as a valid driver's license) upon request, and must sign an entrance log if requested to do so.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Invited Guests for Special Events</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">When the Library sponsors an event for invited guests (such as an exhibit opening or reception), the appropriate library department will notify security personnel ahead of time to make the necessary arrangements to allow guests to enter.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Participants in Summer Programs</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Persons enrolled in certain summer programs, such as Upward Bound and Temple Minority Access to Research Careers (TMARC), will be able to enter the Libraries with their Temple IDs while the summer programs are in session.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Minors</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Persons under the age of 18 (and who are not otherwise authorized to enter the Libraries by one of the group descriptions above) must be accompanied by an adult caregiver. The caregiver must remain in the Library at all times while the minor is present and shall be responsible for the minor&rsquo;s compliance with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/about/policies/code-conduct-library-users\">Code of Conduct for Library Users</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Printer usage must be conducted during regular DSC hours. Though you will operate the software to run the machine DSC staff will be available to assist should you have questions or issues. Should the 3D printer experience any mechanical issues while you are using it you will immediately seek assistance of a DSC staff member and not try to remedy the issue yourself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Costs for prints are due at time of pickup and vary based on material:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">$0.50 per mL of standard resin (as output by the Form 2 printer) $0.20 per gram for PLA and ABS<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">$0.30 for most specialty filaments (wood composites, etc.) General Policies &middot; Please submit print request no later than 5 business days prior to deadline.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\">Print requests must be picked up by the person who initiated the request within 5 business days of notification of completion.

Rafts and supports are included in the total weight of the object and therefore included in the price of the object. Patrons are responsible for removing any supports or rafts on the printed object.</li>\r\n<li class=\"p1\">Items printed with the 3D printer may have small surface defects such as bumps or holes. These routine defects will not be cause for refund or lack of payment for the object.
