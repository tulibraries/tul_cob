      "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Through the Open Access Publishing Fund, we support faculty who would like to publish in an open access journal but do not have the funds to cover an article processing fee.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Libraries’ goal in starting an Open Access Publishing Fund is to promote new forms of scholarly communication. There are a rising number of high-quality open access publishers whose business model depends on the fees they collect from authors. Authors are increasingly interested in making their work available open access, as it helps them reach new and wider audiences. However, the costs involved can be a deterrent. We hope this Fund will help remove this financial barrier, encouraging authors to experiment with new and innovative publishing models.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Open Access Publishing Fund is open to all current Temple faculty members. Current postdoctoral fellows and graduate students may also apply, as long as there is at least one faculty member listed as a co-author on the article.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">How to apply</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Authors with a journal article that has been accepted or is under consideration by an open access publisher are encouraged to apply. Authors simply fill out a <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/scholarlycommunication/files/2018/08/OAPublishingFundApplication2018-2019.docx\"><span class=\"s1\">brief application form</span></a> with their information, a copy of the article, and a copy of the journal acceptance letter (if available).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Funds will be available on a first come, first served basis. <strong>**As of February 1, 2019, the OA Publishing Fund has been exhausted, and we are no longer accepting applications for this fiscal year (July 1, 2018–June 30, 2019). Please check back after July 1, 2019.**</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Libraries will aim to make a final decision regarding the application within two weeks’ time. If the request is approved, Libraries will transfer funds to authors’ research fund or departmental account. The Libraries cannot reimburse authors or pay publishers directly.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Applicant eligibility</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Applicants must be a current Temple University faculty member OR a current postdoctoral fellow/resident/graduate student with a faculty member listed as a co-author.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Applicants with external grant funding that could cover, either in whole or in part, the cost of any publication and processing fees are ineligible.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Applicants must agree to deposit a copy of their publication in our <a href=\"https://digital.library.temple.edu/digital/\"><span class=\"s1\">Digital Library</span></a>, or any future library repository.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Publication eligibility</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\">The publication must take the form of a peer-reviewed journal article.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Many subscription journals now offer an open access option in which authors can chose to pay a fee to make their article open access. These publications are sometimes called “hybrid” open access journals. Articles in “hybrid” journals are not supported.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">The journal must be listed in the <a href=\"https://doaj.org/\"><span class=\"s1\">Directory of Open Access Journals</span></a> (DOAJ). The DOAJ is a community-curated online directory that indexes high quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">The publisher must be a member of the <a href=\"https://oaspa.org/\"><span class=\"s1\">Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association</span></a> (OASPA), or clearly follow the membership criteria of the organization.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Because the Libraries already cover 50% of the APC for <a href=\"https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/institutional-support/membership/1600019565\"><span class=\"s1\">BioMed Central journals</span></a>, these journals are not eligible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Additional stipulations</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Each applicant may request up to $1,500 total per fiscal year. This amount may be split across multiple applications so long as funds are available.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">For articles with multiple Temple authors, the per article payment is capped at $3,000.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Funding will cover publication and processing fees only. Funds may not be used for reprints, color illustration fees, non-open access page charges, permissions fees, web hosting for self-archiving, or other expenses not directly related to open access fees.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">For applicants who have not yet submitted for publication, requests will be conditionally approved awaiting official acceptance by the publisher. All conditional approvals will expire six months after notification. Applicants must provide a copy of the acceptance letter before the invoice is processed.</li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Fees are prorated for multi-authored articles. Co-authors from outside of Temple are not supported. If an article includes non-Temple authors, the APC will be divided equally among all authors and then the Temple authors’ portion will be funded. For example, if the APC is $2000, and there are four authors, two of whom are from Temple, the authors can apply for $1000 from the fund ($500 each).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Attribution requirement</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\">Authors who receive support must include the following statement in their acknowledgements: <em>Publication of this article was funded in part by the Temple University Libraries Open Access Publishing Fund.</em>\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "description": "<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. What is an ETD?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. ETD stands for “Electronic Thesis or Dissertation.” ETDs are often gathered by the degree-granting institution and deposited into digital repositories for public access.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. Where can I find ETDs from Temple University?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. You can view Temple University ETDs in our <a href=\"http://digital.library.temple.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/p245801coll10\"><span class=\"s1\">digital collections repository</span></a>. You can search the ETD collection using your name as keyword.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are unable to find your ETD and it has been more than six (6) months since your PhD or Master's degree was awarded, please email <a href=\"mailto:diglib@temple.edu\"><span class=\"s1\">diglib@temple.edu</span></a> with your full name, dissertation title, department, and date submitted so we can look into any issues. It is our understanding that ProQuest uploads your dissertation into their <a href=\"http://libproxy.temple.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/pqdt/index?accountid=14270\"><span class=\"s1\">database</span></a> within 6-8 weeks from the end of the semester.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. Is my dissertation listed in your online library catalog?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. Yes. We copy the record describing your dissertation from the repository into the <a href=\"https://librarysearch.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Library Search</span></a>.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: I am a PhD student at Temple—must I submit my dissertation electronically?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: Yes. As of September 2008, all PhD candidates must submit their dissertations electronically, and grant a limited non-exclusive license to Temple to include the dissertation in the University Libraries’ ETD repository.  </p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: I am a Master’s degree student at Temple—do I need to submit my masters paper or thesis electronically?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: Yes. As of August 2010, Master's degree candidates presenting a thesis (as opposed to a master's paper) are required to submit the thesis in electronic format and grant a limited non-exclusive license to Temple to include the thesis in the University Libraries’ ETD repository. Master's papers do not have to be submitted electronically.  </p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. How do I submit my Temple dissertation or master’s thesis?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. You will submit your dissertation or thesis through ProQuest. You can follow the instructions at the <a href=\"http://www.etdadmin.com/cgi-bin/school?siteId=171\"><span class=\"s1\">ProQuest ETD submittal site</span></a> for Temple University. If the instructions are unclear or you have questions on how to prepare your thesis or dissertation, check the Temple dissertation instructions in the <a href=\"http://www.temple.edu/grad/documents/dissertation-and-thesis-handbook.pdf\"><span class=\"s1\">Dissertation and Thesis Handbook</span></a>. Contact the <a href=\"http://www.temple.edu/grad/\"><span class=\"s1\">Temple Graduate School</span></a> if further help is needed either in formatting your paper, or to understand either your rights and the University’s graduation requirements—they are the experts in how to properly format and submit your thesis or dissertation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Be sure that what you submit to the Graduate School and ProQuest is the final, fully proofread version. We cannot accept changes to the final submitted document.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: I do not want to give up my copyright!</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: Good news! You retain copyright of your work. The submittal mechanism only grants ProQuest and Temple limited non-exclusive licenses to reproduce the dissertation or master’s thesis. Please read the publishing agreement from ProQuest for full details.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: I want to publish my dissertation (or master’s thesis) as a book.</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: Granting Temple University a limited non-exclusive license to preserve and present your work in our institutional ETD repository does not prevent you from revising and publishing your research in whole or in part. Publishers generally regard the unrevised dissertation or master’s thesis as substantially different from a monograph.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: Will I receive royalties?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: ProQuest will if you select the “traditional publishing” option during submittal. ProQuest will pay royalties of 10% of its net revenue from sales of the work, conditioned on the author maintaining a current address on record with ProQuest. Royalties will be paid when accrued earned royalties reach $25.00 USD. If, after 25 years, earned royalties do not accrue to at least $25.00 USD, ProQuest's royalty payment obligation will cease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Be aware, however, that an open access copy of your work will be freely available online via the Libraries’ ETD repository. Temple University does not pay royalties. For more information on open access scholarship, view Temple’s <a href=\"https://guides.temple.edu/openaccess\"><span class=\"s1\">Open Access Research Guide</span></a>.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: I do not want my dissertation (or master’s thesis) publicly accessible via the web. What do I do?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: For both dissertations and master's theses, making your contribution to scholarship publicly accessible is a requirement in order to receive the degree from Temple University. You may, however, request that an embargo be placed on your dissertation or thesis for up to two years, during which time the ETD would not be publicly accessible. At the end of the embargo period, your work will be available through<a href=\"http://www.proquest.com/go/pqdtglobal\"><span class=\"s1\"> ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses</span></a>,<a href=\"http://www.proquest.com/go/iparadigms\"><span class=\"s1\"> iParadigms</span></a> and<a href=\"http://dissexpress.umi.com/dxweb/\"><span class=\"s1\"> Dissertation Express</span></a>, and a citation/abstract may appear in some<a href=\"http://www.proquest.com/go/third-party-pqdt\"><span class=\"s1\"> indexes</span></a> (e.g. SciFinder, MathSciNet, PsycINFO, etc.). In addition, the Libraries’ will automatically expose the scholarship in the ETD repository. If you need an extension, please contact the Graduate School.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: There are some images and diagrams from another author that I would like to include in my dissertation. Can I just include them?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: Images, diagrams, or other materials from third-party sources may be under copyright. If you include copyrighted material of any sort in your dissertation/thesis, you MUST obtain the copyright holder's written permission for its inclusion and subsequent distribution. For instructions, and an example copyright permission letter, please see the <a href=\"http://www.temple.edu/grad/documents/dissertation-and-thesis-handbook.pdf\"><span class=\"s1\">Dissertation and Thesis Handbook</span></a>. If you need help or have additional questions about copyright, contact your subject librarian.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. There is an error in my dissertation. What do I do?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. Contact the Graduate School to discuss your options.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. I made a mistake in the submittal process. What do I do?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. Contact the Graduate School and explain the nature of the mistake. In the case of an omitted file, such as an appendix or musical score, this can be resolved through them. For other errors, such as requesting that ProQuest not release or sell on your behalf print copies of your dissertation, you should ask that the Graduate School assist you in contacting ProQuest.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q. Why is my name (or dissertation title) in all capital letters in the description?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A. We copy the submitted description without any editing. Formatting, such as capitalization, is carried over from the submission to ProQuest.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: What does the library do to promote wider visibility and reading of my dissertation or master’s thesis?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A.  We upload the metadata describing your paper to three international databases:</p>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s3\">Temple University Library Search</span></a>.<br></span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://www.ndltd.org/\"><span class=\"s3\">The Networked Library of Digital Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD)</span></a>.<br></span></li>\r\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/\"><span class=\"s3\">WorldCat</span></a>.<br></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">By listing the descriptive citation and abstract of your work in these international databases, anyone doing research in your specific area of study should turn up your work and find the embedded link back to to Temple’s ETD repository. Studies at other ETD repositories show that such exposure increases how often dissertations will be cited well beyond a simple listing in the fee-based ProQuest Dissertations database. Posting in a free open repository increases your impact on the scholarly world.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: Is a print copy of my dissertation (or master’s thesis) on the shelf somewhere in Paley Library?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: If you submitted an ETD, we do not keep a paper or microfilm copy of the dissertation. For dissertations submitted prior to September 2008, we do have paper and microfilm copies at locations listed in the <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Temple University Library Search</span></a>.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Q: Who keeps a backup copy of my dissertation then?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A: For dissertations or theses submitted electronically, the Libraries maintain, in a secure electronic storage system, an online disk backup of the PDF as submitted to us. That file is automatically backed up on additional disk arrays. The metadata and PDF included in the publicly searchable ETD repository is also backed up at two data centers in Ohio. We do not make or accept paper printouts of dissertations or theses submitted electronically. ProQuest also <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/products-services/dissertations/publishing-preservation.html\"><span class=\"s1\">preserves microform copies</span></a> of all electronically submitted dissertations.</p>",

      "description": "<h3 class=\"p1\">In-person research at the SCRC</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The best way to perform research using SCRC materials is to visit us in person. Students and researchers are welcome to request materials to use in the Reading Room. If it your first time visiting us, you’ll need to <a href=\"https://temple.aeon.atlas-sys.com/logon\"><span class=\"s1\">register</span></a> for an <a href=\"https://temple.aeon.atlas-sys.com/logon\"><span class=\"s1\">SCRC Researcher Account</span></a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Our collections are maintained in closed stacks and do not circulate, and all materials requested (except microforms) may be used only in the Reading Room.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Please be aware that many of our collections may be housed off-site at the Library Depository, and require up to two business days to retrieve. Please contact us in advance so that materials may be relocated to the reading room for your visit.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Remote reference assistance</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If you cannot visit us in person, we invite you to contact the SCRC staff for <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/scrc/ask\"><span class=\"s1\">reference assistance</span></a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In all reference requests, please include your name and complete contact information, as well as your specific question. You may <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/collections/scrc/ask\"><span class=\"s1\">email</span></a>, submit a request on <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/scrc/ask\"><span class=\"s1\">our Ask SCRC page</span></a>, call (215-204-8257), or write us (SCRC, Charles Library, Temple University Libraries, 1900 N. Thirteenth St., Philadelphia, PA 19122).</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Please understand that due to staffing constraints, we are not able to provide in-depth research services. Questions are addressed in the order in which they are received, and response time will vary.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Research Assistance</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The SCRC staff is not able to provide research services, except to Temple University administration.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The SCRC has only a few resources relevant to genealogical researchers, and some of those are restricted due to privacy and confidentiality issues. However, for remote researchers, SCRC staff will look up 4 biographical/genealogical entries per researcher, annually. Researchers interested in more than 4 entries per year are encouraged to visit our reading room to conduct their own research, where the 4 entry limit does not apply, during our normal hours of operation, Monday-Friday, 8:30am-5:30pm.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">SCRC Research Guides</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Guides to select topics and subjects available for research in the Special Collections Research Center can be found on this page.  More will be added soon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">These guides represent a small portion of the possible research topics in our collections. Please <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/scrc/ask\"><span class=\"s1\">contact us</span></a> for research assistance or to <a href=\"https://temple.aeon.atlas-sys.com/logon\"><span class=\"s1\">request to view these materials</span></a> in our reading room.</p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li4\">\n<span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://guides.temple.edu/scrcmilitaryhistory\"><span class=\"s3\">Military History resources</span></a></span><span class=\"s4\"><br></span>\n</li>\r\n<li class=\"li4\">\n<span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://guides.temple.edu/c.php?g=472345\"><span class=\"s3\">LGBTQ resources</span></a></span><span class=\"s4\"><br></span>\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">How to Cite SCRC Materials</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In all cases, researchers must cite the SCRC as the source with the appropriate credit line provided below:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">[Description and date of item], [Box/folder number], [Collection title], [Collection ID], Special Collections Research Center, Temple University Libraries, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If the material is under copyright, researchers must cite all copyright information and comply with all other terms or restrictions that may be applicable to that material.</p>",
