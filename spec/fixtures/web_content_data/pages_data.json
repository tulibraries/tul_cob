      "description": "<p>August 2018</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">On behalf of Temple University Libraries, welcome to the 2018&ndash;2019 academic year. If you have visited us on main campus lately, I&rsquo;m sure you have noticed the progress on our new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/newlibrary\"><span class=\"s1\">Charles Library</span></a>&nbsp;(if you haven&rsquo;t, view our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/webcams\"><span class=\"s1\">livestream</span></a>). Even as we anticipate its grand opening next year, we are busy with myriad other activities, from developing new projects to growing our collections to providing valuable services.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In August, we released an enhanced version of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Library Search</span></a>, which allows you to more easily discover the resources you need, including books, e-books, journals, videos/DVDs, government documents, journal articles, and our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digital.library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">digital collections</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Library Search also allows you to browse materials in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/scrc\"><span class=\"s1\">Special Collections Research Center (SCRC)</span></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/collections/blockson\"><span class=\"s1\">Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection</span></a>. I encourage you to visit these two very special collections in person too, in order to encounter their rare and unique materials first-hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As always, our expert&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/services/library-instruction/specialists\"><span class=\"s1\">subject librarians</span></a>&nbsp;are available for questions and consultations in a variety of ways&mdash;from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Ask a Librarian</span></a>&nbsp;chat window on the library&rsquo;s homepage, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/asktulibraries#tab5\"><span class=\"s1\">text messaging</span></a>, to in-person and online&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/asktulibraries#tab2\"><span class=\"s1\">appointments</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The Libraries continue to be your center for collaboration, innovation, and gathering. Receive expert guidance on using the latest technology in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/\"><span class=\"s1\">Digital Scholarship Center</span></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guides.temple.edu/innovationspace\"><span class=\"s1\">Innovation Space</span></a>, sign up for free&nbsp;<a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage?event-category%5B%5D=7\"><span class=\"s1\">library workshops</span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paleystudy.temple.edu/\"><span class=\"s1\">book group study rooms</span></a>&nbsp;ahead of time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">And don&rsquo;t forget to check out the free cultural and academic programs we offer during the academic year as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/beyondthepage\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond the Page</span></a>&nbsp;public programming series. The theme for this year is Access &amp; Opportunity, and we invite you to join us in conversations about what barriers&mdash;whether cultural, financial, physical, or otherwise&mdash;limit opportunities and how we can move toward a more accessible world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">For current updates, programs, and resources, consider following the Libraries on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instagram.com/tulibraries/\"><span class=\"s1\">Instagram</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://facebook.com/templelibraries/\"><span class=\"s1\">Facebook</span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/TempleLibraries\"><span class=\"s1\">Twitter</span></a>. And visit us, either in person or online, for inspiration, for encouragement, and for connection. I wish you the best this academic year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">With warm regards,</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Joe Lucia</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Dean of University Libraries</p>",

      "title": "TULUP Diversity Statement",
      "description": "<h3 class=\"p1\">Introduction</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In 2017, the Temple University Libraries &amp; University Press (TULUP) Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) Committee was charged with mapping the trajectory of diversity and inclusion initiatives at TULUP. The TULUP D&amp;I Committee facilitated the creation of a Diversity Statement in order to guide TULUP&rsquo;s commitment to the range of human representations in all areas of our work. In an effort to exemplify a commitment to engaging diverse voices, all TULUP staff were invited to share their input on the statement. The TULUP D&amp;I Committee used these suggestions to shape the Diversity Statement you see below and continues to work diligently to facilitate TULUP&rsquo;s upholding of the principles within it.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Diversity Statement</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The staff of Temple University Libraries and Press strive to engage, include, and serve the full diversity of the Temple academic and local communities regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, socioeconomic status, veteran status, culture, language, political views, citizenship status, or diverse abilities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We are dedicated to the principles and practices of social justice, diversity, and equity among our staff, collections, and services.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">While our staff is not as diverse as the communities we serve, we are working toward our commitment to the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We hope to act as a catalyst to our users to challenge their own assumptions and viewpoints, while also intentionally building collections and services that let users see themselves reflected. We strive to create safe spaces in our buildings and on our websites, and do not tolerate harassment or hate speech in any form.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We're fully committed to eliminating barriers to learning and fostering access for our communities. The development of a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment is a continuous process. We&rsquo;re taking small steps every day towards our goals, including regular attention to these issues and calls to action from our standing Diversity and Inclusion Committee.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">How could we be doing better? Let us know at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:asktulibrary@temple.edu\"><span class=\"s1\">asktulibrary@temple.edu</span></a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"p1\">(Revised &amp; Re-affirmed, September 2017)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Temple University Libraries &amp; the University Press will foster learning, enhance intellectual life, amplify scholarly impact, and extend the reach of the imagination for their diverse local, national, and global communities through concerted action in these key areas:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">1. Designing and building a dramatically new library environment to serve as a catalyst for academic enterprise at Temple.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">At the heart of the Temple campus, this new central library will embody emerging modes of library mission while sustaining and transforming traditional library functions and commitments, with a quality and thoughtfulness of design that will be a model for other research universities nationally and internationally in the digital age.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">2. Enriching the environment for learning and student success.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will be a rich ecosystem for learning, providing services, instruction, tools and materials in light of diverse and evolving student needs, interests and predilections, in dialog with faculty and administrators, with an emphasis on curricular integration of information literacy, personalization and personal contact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">3. Developing programs, services, and resources to enhance intellectual productivity, scholarly infrastructure, new modes of research, and clinical care services.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will support a diverse environment for the exploration of new modes of scholarship, engaging all fields of academic endeavor as a multi-disciplinary contact zone and intellectual workshop, connecting students, clinicians and scholars with collections, tools, librarians, and technical experts.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">4. Exploring new opportunities in publishing and scholarly communication.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will engage in deep collaboration with Temple University Press, with Temple faculty, and with other organizations and academic institutions to identify and adopt new approaches for sharing scholarly products, for exploring sustainable economic models for university publishing, and for connecting local publishing initiatives with Temple&rsquo;s faculty.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">5. Seeking partners in innovation and experimentation to add value to library programs and to identify new avenues for economic support.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will connect with a broad set of partners and collaborators at Temple and beyond to amplify their capacity for innovation, invention, and the exploration of emerging opportunities, both in technological domains (gaming, data visualization, data management, digital scholarship, health informatics etc.) and in areas where new revenue opportunities may be involved (publishing, foundation support, corporate partnerships, donor support, joint training and certification programs, etc.).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">6. Serving as a center of intellectual and cultural life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The libraries will engage with schools and colleges, academic departments, interest groups, individuals, and community organizations to stimulate conversation, support the exchange of ideas, to provide a lively agenda of events, serving as a center of intellectual, cultural and civic life for Temple University and its neighboring urban community.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">7. Serving as a repository of record for archival, rare, and unique materials and providing broad access to those collections.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Building on deep archives and special collections that reflect not only Temple&rsquo;s institutional history, mission, and geographical centrality to the Philadelphia urban community, but also its commitment to intellectual engagement in the arts, book arts, and alternative movements, and recognizing the reputation of the Blockson Collection as an important resource for African American history and culture, the libraries will continue to expand their holdings, providing access to an ever growing set of their holdings in digital form.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">8. Building a world-class staff for leadership in the research library enterprise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Recognizing that leadership, innovation, creativity, and dynamism in any enterprise are the product of personal commitment and staff empowerment, the libraries will create a flexible and forward-looking work environment that embraces transparent management practices, clear communication channels, individual accountability, fiscal responsibility, efficiency, a culture of experiment and continuous learning, opportunities for growth, and work-life balance, with the goal of becoming a model organization for contemporary research libraries.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">9. Sharing the vision, making connections, broadening support.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">As Temple University Libraries realize the ambition to be leaders in defining 21st century academic librarianship, they must share their story and build on successes and lessons learned, identifying further opportunities for growth and innovation, and opening up new avenues for support and partnership via private, corporate and foundation philanthropy and through cooperative enterprise with other organizations and institutions nationally and globally.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>",

If you would like to donate materials for the general collections, please contact Acquisitions &amp; Collection Development via email at jbrian@temple.edu.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">To donate archival, rare, or special collection materials, or items documenting the history of Temple University, please send a description to Margery Sly, msly@temple.edu. The University Libraries&rsquo; Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) Research Center welcomes inquiries about potential donations of books, documents, organizational records, photographs, and other materials that complement our research collections.

Temple University cannot provide monetary appraisals of donated material or pay for such appraisals due to IRS regulations. If you wish to have a gift appraised, we can offer a list of reputable independent appraisers whom you may contact directly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Once accepted, your gift becomes the property of the Temple University Libraries. If any materials are ultimately not added to the collections, we reserve the right to dispose of the material as necessary through exchange, sale, or other means.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Forms and helpful links</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8283.pdf\"><strong>IRS form 8283</strong></a></span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"p3\">Questions?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Contact Brian Schoolar at <a href=\"mailto:jbrian@temple.edu\"><span class=\"s3\">jbrian@temple.edu</span></a>.</p>",
