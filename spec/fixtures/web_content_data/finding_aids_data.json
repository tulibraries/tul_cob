Morgenstern also served as vice president of the council’s outreach program and co-chair of the Adopt-A-Family program and as a delegate to Soviet Jewry conferences in Brussels and Israel.  On two occasions, in 1975 and 1977, she visited Refuseniks in the Soviet Union.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Description of Collection </strong></div>\n<div>The Bobbie Morgenstern Papers on Soviet Jewry document Bobbie Morgenstern’s involvement in the Soviet Jewry movement to advocate, aid, and communicate with Refuseniks, Jews denied permission by the Soviet government to emigrate. The collection includes correspondence, photographs of Refuseniks and members of their families, a trip debriefing report and itinerary, planning materials related to outreach activities including the Soviet Jewry Council’s Adopt-A-Family and Bar/Bat Mitzvah Twinning programs and Silent No More, conference materials, newspaper clippings, and an audio recording of Refusenik Ida Nudel. The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence Morgenstern received from Refuseniks primarily between 1976 and 1978, among them Army Colonel Yefim Davidovich, Alexander Lerner, Ida Nudel, Alexander Paritsky, and Eugene Reinberg. Some of the correspondence is in Russian or Yiddish.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span><strong>Patron Information </strong></span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Catalog Record </strong></div>\n<div>A record for this collection is available in Temple University’s online library catalog: <a>https://librarysearch.temple.edu/catalog/991036984099903811</a>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Research Access </strong></div>\n<div>Collection is open for research.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Collections Stored Off-Site</strong></div>\n<div>This collection may be housed off-site at the Library Depository, and require up to two business days to retrieve.
