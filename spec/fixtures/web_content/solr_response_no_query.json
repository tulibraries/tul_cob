Tyler had been a student of Boris Blai, who served on the faculty of Temple’s Oak Lane Country Day School. Temple named Blai, a noted sculptor, the first Dean of the Tyler School, and he served in that capacity until his retirement in 1960. Blai wanted the school’s curriculum to include the liberal arts along with the fine arts, and to require the study of various art techniques before specialization in one. Charles Le Clair succeeded Blai as Dean in 1960 and expanded the curriculum to include graphic arts, a Master of Fine Arts degree, and the study abroad program in Rome in 1965. \n\tThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tyler’s curriculum continued to grow, with the addition of classes in design, ceramics, glass, metals, and photography. Tyler developed the Art, Art Education, and Art History departments on Temple’s main campus in North Philadelphia. Tyler graphic arts students developed the Temple “T” symbol in 1983. Exhibitions of the work of students and faculty, as well as local, national and international artists were held on the Tyler campus. Visiting scholars and artists offered lectures and classes. The school added an exhibition gallery to the University’s Center City building at 1619 Walnut Street in 1985, which then moved to the Old City gallery district in 1996. \n\tAfter many years of deliberation among the university administration, Tyler faculty, and students, largely during the tenure of Dean Rochelle Toner, the University relocated Tyler School of Art to Temple’s main campus in a specially constructed building in 2008.\n\tDescription of Collection \n\tThis collection was part of the Tyler Archives Project established by the Tyler library at the Elkins Park campus to document the work of Tyler faculty and alumni.  Materials retained as part of this collection include library administrative files as well as material of historic interest from the school.  Advertising material and catalogs for the school as well as from summer sessions and the Rome campus, scrapbooks, guest books and financial ledgers are also included.  Memos, correspondence, and clippings tracing the history of various plans to move the school to the Main Campus are a significant part of the collection. The collection ends with the move in 2008.\n\tOrganization and Arrangement\n\tThe collection is arranged into 6 series as follows:\n\tSeries 1: Administrative records, 1935-2008\n\t\tSeries 2: Financial ledgers, 1935-1948 \n\t\tSeries 3: Catalogs, brochures, and advertising materials, 1937-2005\n\t\tSubseries 3.1: General catalogs, brochures, and advertising materials, 1937-2005 \n\t\tSubseries 3.2: International programs, 1966-2001\n\t\tSeries 4: Scrapbooks and guest books, 1963-1979\n\t\tSeries 5: Audiovisual materials, 1963-2001\n\t\tSeries 6: Memorabilia and ephemera, 1906-1991\n\t\n\tSeries 1 contains faculty vitae, library records, student lists, exhibition memos to staff, student and graduation lists and clippings and memos concerning the move to the Main Campus, 1935-2008.\n\tSeries 2 contains financial ledgers of miscellaneous expenditures and petty cash, 1935-1948.\n\tSeries 3 contains catalogs, advertising brochures, and publicity posters for the school and its various programs, 1937-2005.\n\tSeries 4 contains guest books with signatures of visitors to the campus and scrapbooks of news clippings and personal memorabilia, 1943-1993.\n\tSeries 5 contains a CD, DVD, and reel to reel audio tape of faculty work and an alumni event, 1963-2001.\n\tSeries 6 contains color charts, blank forms, a stencil, and the Elkins, Tyler Widener, Dixon family tree, 1906-1991.\n\t\n\tPatron Information\n\tCatalog Record \n\tA record for this collection is available in Temple University’s online library catalog: http://diamond.temple.edu/record=b5807298~S30\n\tResearch Access\n\tCollection is open for research.\n\tCollections Stored Off-Site\n\tThis collection may be housed off-site at the Library Depository, and require up to two business days to retrieve.
