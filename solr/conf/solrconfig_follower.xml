    <!-- To use compression while transferring the index files. The possible

         that your master Solr has the settings to honor the accept-encoding header.
         See here for details: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrHttpCompression
         If it is 'internal' everything will be taken care of automatically.
         USE THIS ONLY IF YOUR BANDWIDTH IS LOW.
